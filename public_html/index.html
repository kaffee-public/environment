        <h1>Environment project</h1>
        <h3>e00</h3>
        <h4>The zeroth environment is made up of projects only; as they are managed by the IDE.</h4>
        <p>The default IDE to use is NetBeans. I've chosen NetBeans at this point because of it's simplicity and out-of-the-box nature.</p>
        <p>Each project has it's own build/dist/lib folders which is not optimal.</p>
        <h4>Installation</h4>
        <p>No specific install; use NetBeans to create projects and their folders.</p>
        <h4>Removal</h4>
        <p>Simply delete the folder e00 from your system.</p>
        <h3>e01</h3>

        <h2>Rolling ideas</h2>
        <h3>These ideas are to built into the environment/build system as it evolves. It's just a bulletin; no dependencies are illustrated here.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>dictionary support with <b>aspell</b> integration. Project-specific names are also included; developer's ids, technical abbrevations etc.</li>
            <li>OS integration (shell too) of file templates; with the author and other stuff pre-assembled</li>
        </ul>
